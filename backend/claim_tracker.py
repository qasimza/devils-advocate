You are analyzing a live debate transcript. The user is defending a business idea against
an adversarial AI agent.

USER'S ORIGINAL CLAIM: {original_claim}

RECENT DEBATE CONTEXT:
{context}

USER'S LATEST TURN: "{user_turn}"

Classify the user's latest turn as exactly ONE of:
- DEFENDED: User made a substantive counter-argument that addressed the agent's attack
- CONCEDED: User admitted a weakness, agreed with the agent, or gave ground
- NEW_CLAIM: User introduced a new aspect of their idea not previously discussed
- DEFLECTED: User changed subject or gave a non-answer

Respond with ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:
{{
    "classification": "DEFENDED",
    "summary": "One sentence summary of what the user argued",
    "strength": 7
}}

strength is 1-10 (10 = very compelling argument, 1 = very weak).
